Raw data for ICSE 2021 submission

The actual raw data is contained in a release, as the zip and files are too large to upload directly.  The data can be found in the file *rawdata.zip*, here: https://github.com/mutantsforstaticanalysis/rawdata/releases/download/icse2021/rawdata.zip.  See the README.md in that zip for more information on the contents.
